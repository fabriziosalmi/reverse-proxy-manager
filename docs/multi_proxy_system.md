# Multi-Proxy System Documentation

The Italia CDN Proxy supports multiple reverse proxy types to provide flexibility and optimize for different use cases. This document describes the differences, capabilities, and limitations of each supported proxy type.

## Supported Proxy Types

Currently, the system supports three proxy types:

1. **Nginx** - The default and most feature-rich option
2. **Caddy** - A modern, automatic HTTPS web server
3. **Traefik** - A dynamic, container-friendly reverse proxy and load balancer

## Detailed Feature Descriptions

### Nginx

**Strengths:**
- Industry standard with proven reliability
- Exceptional performance and low resource usage
- Extensive configuration options
- Powerful caching, rate limiting, and WAF integration
- Well-documented with large community support

**Limitations:**
- Manual SSL certificate management
- Configuration can be complex
- Requires reload for configuration changes
- Less container-friendly than Traefik

**Best for:**
- High-traffic production environments
- Complex routing requirements
- Environments where performance is critical
- When advanced WAF features are needed

### Caddy

**Strengths:**
- Automatic HTTPS with Let's Encrypt
- Simple, readable configuration
- No-reload configuration changes
- Low maintenance overhead
- Built-in HTTP/3 support

**Limitations:**
- Limited advanced WAF capabilities
- Fewer tuning options than Nginx
- Higher memory usage than Nginx
- Fewer third-party modules

**Best for:**
- Quick deployments
- Environments where automatic HTTPS is valuable
- Projects where simplicity is preferred over fine-grained control
- Teams without deep proxy configuration expertise

### Traefik

**Strengths:**
- Excellent container integration (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Dynamic configuration
- Auto-discovery of services
- Built for microservices architectures
- Dashboard for monitoring

**Limitations:**
- Less mature than Nginx
- WAF functionality requires plugins
- Performance may not match Nginx under extreme load
- Configuration documentation can be lacking

**Best for:**
- Container orchestration environments
- Microservices architectures
- Dynamic cloud environments
- When service auto-discovery is beneficial

## Feature Compatibility Notes

### HTTPS and SSL

- **Nginx**: Requires manual certificate configuration and renewal scripts
- **Caddy**: Automatic certificate issuance and renewal
- **Traefik**: Automatic with Let's Encrypt integration

### WAF (Web Application Firewall)

- **Nginx**: Full ModSecurity support with OWASP CRS
- **Caddy**: Limited WAF capabilities through custom directives
- **Traefik**: Requires third-party plugins like traefik-modsecurity

### Caching

- **Nginx**: Sophisticated caching with fine-grained controls
- **Caddy**: Basic built-in caching directives
- **Traefik**: Basic caching through plugins

### GeoIP Filtering

- **Nginx**: Built-in with GeoIP module
- **Caddy**: With MaxMind DB integration
- **Traefik**: Through plugins

## Deployment Considerations

When selecting which proxy type to use for your nodes, consider:

1. **Existing Expertise**: Use what your team knows best
2. **Environment Type**: Container vs traditional virtualization
3. **Feature Requirements**: Advanced WAF, caching needs, etc.
4. **Management Overhead**: Auto-HTTPS vs manual certificate management
5. **Performance Needs**: High-traffic sites may benefit from Nginx

## Node Type Compatibility 

When deploying sites to multiple node types:

- Some features may not be available across all proxy types
- WAF configurations may differ in implementation
- Caching behavior may vary
- Custom configurations may need to be proxy-specific

The system will attempt to translate configurations between proxy types when possible, but some advanced features may require proxy-specific configuration.

## Best Practices

1. Use the same proxy type for all nodes when possible
2. Test deployments when using multiple proxy types
3. Keep advanced features in separate configurations when using mixed proxy types
4. Consider which features are critical when selecting proxy types
5. Document any proxy-specific configurations for your sites
